# You Fight

## You grab up the courage, pick the nearest stone and smash it on the trolls head. With your immense stregth, you slayed the foul creature in one swoop. You then go to grab the sword and continue venture forth into the dungeon, slaying anything in your path. After a while, you find the exit and leave.
